# Build a DJ Application with IBM Bob
#AI building team
a basic DeckFlow web application, a two-deck DJ mixer built on Web Audio and Elementary Audio (running as WASM in an AudioWorklet). In this lab, you use IBM Bob to add new features to the application based on a specification document.

IBM Bob is your AI development partner for the full software lifecycle, from planning to delivery. IBM Bob accelerates software development by automating complex, time‑consuming work, from building new features to modernizing legacy systems and strengthening secure delivery. Teams can ship high‑quality software with less effort and greater control over AI cost and outcomes.

## Learning objectives

After completing this lab, you should be able to:

- Create a comprehensive planning document.
- Implement more features based on a specification document.
- Test the new features.
- Explore new features and potential pitfalls in the implementation plan.

## Vibe coding

Vibe coding is a modern approach to software development where you describe what you want in plain language, and AI tools generate the code for you. Instead of focusing on writing every line of code, developers focus on their intent, guiding and refining the AI’s output. This shift makes coding more flexible, faster, and accessible, especially for rapid prototyping and experimentation. Overall, it represents a move from syntax-driven coding to intent-driven, AI-assisted development.

Vibe coding is powerful for speed and creativity, but its weaknesses, such as poor structure, inconsistent quality, and limited understanding, make it hard to scale. As a result, teams naturally transition to spec-driven development, where clearer requirements guide both humans and AI toward more reliable, maintainable systems.

As projects grow in complexity, teams often move from vibe coding to spec-driven development, shifting from loosely defined prompts to clear, detailed specifications that guide both humans and AI toward better outcomes.

Spec-driven development is a more structured approach where requirements, constraints, and design details are clearly defined upfront. AI (or developers) then implement against those specifications, resulting in more reliable, maintainable systems. For this reason, this lab uses a specification document written by a developer with the assitance of AI.

## Task 1: Clone and open the starter project

The `03_djapp_july` is a pre-built starter project that includes a basic DJ web application. Follow these steps to clone the repository as a starting point for the project:

1. In IBM Bob, verify whether the terminal panel is visible. If you don't see a terminal panel, click **Terminal > New Terminal**.

2. In the terminal, copy and paste these commands to clone the starter project and open it:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IBM-SkillsBuild-AI-Builders-Challenge/hands-on-labs.git
   cd 03_djapp_july
   ```

2. **Important:** In IBM Bob, click **File > Open Folder**, then open the `03_djapp_july` folder that you just cloned to make sure that all file paths in subsequent prompts work correctly. Note that the GitHub repository contains multiple folders and labs, however, this lab is specific to the `03_djapp_july` folder.

3. Review the project structure.

## Task 2: Explore the codebase

Follow these steps to use Bob's Ask mode to explore the existing code base:

1. Click **Start new task**.

1. Switch to **Ask** mode.

1. Copy and paste the following prompt:

    ```
    Explore the codebase for this application.
    What does the app do? Based on the spec, which phases have already been implemented in the application? 
    What needs to be done next?
    Please point out any areas that need particular attention?
    ```

1. To confirm permission to read the files, click **Approve** when prompted by Bob.

1. Review the results. Bob's response is similar to the following response:

## Task 3: Create an implementation plan

Follow these steps to use Bob's Plan mode to create an implementation plan:

1. Click **Start new task**.

1. Switch to **Plan** mode.

1. Copy and paste the following prompt:

    ```
    Read the files in this folder.
    Then read the spec.md file to create a implementation plan for phase 4.
    The app is currently in the phase 3 stage.
    The implementation plan should add the phase 4 features to the existing phase 3 app.
    ```

1. To confirm permission to read the files, click **Approve** when prompted by Bob.

1. Review the ToDo list, and then click **Approve** when prompted by Bob.

1. Review the Phase 4 implementation plan details for the following features:
   - Tempo control
   - Cue point
   - Loop functionality
   - Visual markers
   
1. Copy and paste the following prompt:

    ```
    Create a high-level overview first, then detailed breakdowns for each feature (tempo, loops, cue, markers).
    Save the plan as implementation-plan.md in markdown format.
    ```
    
1. Review the ToDo list, and then click **Approve** when prompted by Bob.
